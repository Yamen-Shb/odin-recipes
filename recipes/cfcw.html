            <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>

    </p>

    <p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix flour, salt, 1/2 teaspoon paprika, garlic powder, 
                and black pepper together in a sealable plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Pour evaporated milk into a bowl. Dip a few chicken wings 
                into evaporated milk to coat. Remove wings from milk and 
                shake to remove excess. Put wings into the sealable bag, 
                seal the bag, and shake to coat wings in flour mixture. 
                Move coated wings to a plate, keeping them from touching. 
                Repeat process with remaining wings until all are coated 
                in the flour mixture.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Fry chicken wings in hot olive oil, turning regularly, 
                until browned on all sides and no longer pink at the bone, 
                about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into 
                the thickest part of the meat, near the bone should read 
                165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Season fried wings with 
                additional paprika.</li>
